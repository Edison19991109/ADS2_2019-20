```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I am the *best* student.

- Prepare tutorial
- Go to class
- Revise lecture
- Finish ICA report

1. Eat breakfast
2. Eat lunch
3. Eat dinner
4. Sleep

```{r}
x=2
y=3
x+y
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
2+2
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
2+2
```

```{r}
hist(rnorm(10000), col ="tomato")
```

```{r}
x
```

We determined that the sum 1 and 2 was `r 1+2` surprisingly

```{r}
dragon <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\KANG Jianning\\Documents\\GitKraken\\ADS2_2019-20\\Practicals\\Practical3_Sampling_distributions_and_Cantral_Limit_Theorem\\dragons.csv')
hist(dragon$wingspan)
mean <- {}
for (i in 1:1000) {
  Randomchoose <- sample(500,100)
  mean[i] <- round(mean(dragon$wingspan[c(Randomchoose)]),1)
}
hist(mean)
```

```{r}
dragons <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\KANG Jianning\\Documents\\GitKraken\\ADS2_2019-20\\Practicals\\Practical3_Sampling_distributions_and_Cantral_Limit_Theorem\\dragons.csv')
library(knitr)
kable(dragons[1:5,])
kable(summary(dragons))
```

```{r}
mice <- read.csv("mouse_report.csv")
kable(mice[1:20,c(2,4,5)])
```

```{r}
mice <- read.csv("mouse_report.csv")
kable(summary(mice))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
